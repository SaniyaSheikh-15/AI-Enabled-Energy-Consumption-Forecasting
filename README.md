This project is an *AI-enabled deep learning system* built to forecast *energy consumption across multiple households* using *LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)* networks.  
It leverages realistic large-scale energy data to uncover temporal patterns and predict future energy demand with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧠 *AI-Enabled Forecasting* using LSTM neural networks  
- 🏠 *Multi-Household Analysis* with realistic datasets  
- 📈 *Energy Trend Prediction* for smarter consumption decisions  
- ⚙ Clean, modular code structure for easy model upgrades  

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- Python (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Deep Learning (LSTM)
- Data Visualization Libraries

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Data preprocessing and normalization  
2. Time-series sequence generation for LSTM input  
3. Model training on multi-household dataset  
4. Forecast visualization and error analysis  

## 📈 Future Enhancements
